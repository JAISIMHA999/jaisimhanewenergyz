            <h2>INRODUCTION</h2>
            <p>Welcome to NEW ENERGY SOLUTIONS. We provide top-notch services to our clients.
<li>What are the new energy solutions?
The new energy solutions have the potential to revolutionize the way we generate, store, and consume energy. Solar power has made tremendous strides in recent years. Advances in photovoltaic technology, along with falling costs, have made solar panels more accessible than ever before.</li>

<li>What are the 5 sources of energy?
Primary energy sources take many forms, including nuclear energy, fossil energy -- like oil, coal and natural gas -- and renewable sources like wind, solar, geothermal and hydropower.</li>

<li>*What are the 7 main energy types?
Energy, or the ability to cause changes in matter, can exist in many different forms.
Energy can also change from one form to another. Forms of energy
include mechanical, chemical, electrical, electromagnetic, thermal, sound, and nuclear energy.</li>

<li>Renewable Energy and Why Is It Important?
Renewable energy is energy from natural sources that replenish more than they’re consumed. Solar and wind are the common sources of renewable energy; they’re abundant and are present around us. On the other hand, non-renewable energy like fossil fuels are finite and takes millions of years to replenish. Coal, oil, and gas are non-renewable sources of energy that once burned, generate large amounts of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.
These GHG blankets the planet and trap the sun’s heat, heating up the Earth. Producing renewable energy releases far lower emissions than burning fossil fuels. Moving away from fossil fuels, which currently account for the lion’s share of emissions, to renewable energy is key to addressing the climate crisis.This sustainable energy also helps companies reduce reliance on fossil fuels and thus, cut carbon emissions significantly. So, to avoid the worst effects of climate change, the world has to drastically reduce its GHG emissions. Clean and renewable energy can help us get us there… and it comes with plenty of benefits. Benefits of Using Renewable and Sustainable Energy Powering up with renewables brings a range of benefits, the major one is providing a freely available source of power. As the sector continues to grow, it also creates a surge in job opportunities in developing and installing renewable technologies. Plus, renewables offer better and more affordable access to energy in emerging economies.</li>

<p> A. INRODUCTION OF NEW ENERGY SOLUTIONS:
<li>The new energy solutions have the potential to revolutionize the way we generate, store, and consume energy. Solar power has made tremendous strides in recent years. Advances in photovoltaic technology, along with falling costs, have made solar panels more accessible than ever before.</li>


<li>B. VISION, Mission and values of the organization:</li>

<li>Renewable energy is energy from natural sources that replenish more than they’re consumed. Solar and wind are the common sources of renewable energy; they’re abundant and are present around us.On the other hand, non-renewable energy like fossil fuels are finite and takes millions of years to replenish. Coal, oil, and gas are non-renewable sources of energy that once burned, generate large amounts of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions. These GHG blankets the planet and trap the sun’s heat, heating up the Earth. Producing renewable energy releases far lower emissions than burning fossil fuels. Moving away from fossil fuels, which currently account for thelion’s share of emissions, to renewable energy is key to addressing the climate crisis. This sustainable energy also helps companies reduce reliance on fossil fuels and thus, cut carbon emissions significantly.
So, to avoid the worst effects of climate change, the world has to drastically reduce its GHG emissions. Clean and renewable energy can help us get us there… and it comes with plenty of benefits.</li>

<li>C. Policy of the organization, in relation to the intern role:</li>

<li>Powering up with renewables brings a range of benefits, the major one is providing a freely available source of power.
As the sector continues to grow, it also creates a surge in job opportunities in developing and installing renewable technologies. Plus, renewables offer better and more affordable access to energy in emerging economies. Renewables are now cheaper in most countries and generate 3x more jobs than fossil fuels.
And of course, one of the biggest benefits of sourcing energy from
renewables is the fact that they’re mostly clean and sustainable.</li>

<li>Moreover, rain orshine, the most abundant of renewable resources – solar energy – can be harnessed even in cloudy weather.
And did you know that the rate at which solar energy strikes the Earth is 10,000x more than the rate at which humans consume energy? That means it’s impossible for us to exhaust the energy that the sun provides.It’s just that the world must invest $4 trillion annually in renewable energy by 2030 to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Still, the return on this investment will be more than 6-fold – $26 trillion.</li>


<li>D. Organisational structure:</li>

</li>Producing energy that releases less or no GHG emissions from fossil fuels and reduces air pollution
• Diversifying the energy mix and cutting reliance on imported fuels
• Creating more jobs in manufacturing, installation, maintenance,etc.
However, these benefits are not only possible with renewable sources. Nuclear power, too, is dubbed as a clean, zero-carbon energy source; it emits much lower carbon. Some favor nuclear over renewables like solar and wind because it’s a stable source that doesn’t rely on weather conditions. Still, the pros of renewable and sustainable power sources outweigh their cons and their consumption will continue to increase sharply. So, what are the common renewable energy sources or technologies available right now.</li>	

<li>E. Roles and responsibilities of the employees in which intern is placed:</li>

<li>An Intern, or Trainee, is an individual completing entry-level work for a company to gain experience in their field. Intern job duties vary by industry, but their common responsibilities include learning and becoming proficient in software, completing tasks assigned by their supervisor and attending meetings where they take minutes.
An Intern’s responsibilities and duties vary drastically depending on the industry and company they work for. Some common duties that you can assign to Intern are
•	Fulfilling tasks assigned by a supervisor
•	Performing clerical duties
•	Managing social media accounts
•	Event handling or planning
•	Job shadowing
•	Learning technical skills related to the industry</li>

<li>F. Performance of the organization:</li>

<li>Global energy-related CO2 emissions could be reduced 70% by 2050, IRENA finds. Renewables can account for about half of those reductions, with another 45% coming from increased energy efficiency and electrification.
But maximising such synergies requires a greater understanding of the potential that exists at the country, sector and technology levels. IRENA’s study calls for a system-wide perspective that takes into account the inter-linkages between technologies and sectors.
All countries can benefit from the important synergies between renewable energy and energy efficiency. Specific technologies enable energy efficiency and renewable energy in both the power and end-use sectors. On the end-use side, the electrification of services like passenger transport and cooking heat results in higher efficiency, allowing greater use of renewable power. On the supply side, in turn, the switch to renewable power tends to reduce primary energy demand.</li>

<li>G. Future plans of organization:</li>

<li>This will increase India's total renewable capacity to 448 GW of solar and 122 GW of wind by 2030. India's current goal is to reach 500 GW of installed electricity capacity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030.
Between 2023 and 2030, the country requires USD 293 billion to meet its current goals for solar and wind power, the report said.
However, to further expand the country's renewable energy capacity to align with the IEA net-zero pathway, it will need an additional USD 101 billion.
The think tank highlighted issues such as payment delays and unfavourable rules and regulations that deter investors from providing the necessary funding to achieve these goals. The financial requirements to achieve both the NEP14 target and the IEA net-zero scenario far surpass the current investment and funding capacities available in India, the report said.</li>
